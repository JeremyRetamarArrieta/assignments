Good work.  I like the creativity you bring to it.

Lets work on your html nesting and indentations.  You could do a little better on that.

Good use of alt tags on images and variable names in JS but you have a lot of white space between lines that can be removed.  

Nice work validating that input is a number and resetting the form values after submission.

We can do better on naming conventions.  For example, why give your H1 and id of 'H1'?  It should be something like 'marioPageTitle' and 'containerOne" should be 'goombaContainer', etc.
Focus on making it a priority to keep your code clean.

Overall, nice work and good project.  You are right where you should be.
